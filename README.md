# Python Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Python console game I built to practice basic programming concepts.

## 📌 What it does
The program generates a random number within a given range. The user has to guess the number, and the program provides hints until the user guesses correctly.

## ✅ Concepts Used
- Variables and data types
- Random number generation
- Loops (while loop)
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- User input handling
- Basic debugging and error handling

## ▶️ How to run it
1. Clone this repository or download the `.py` file.
2. Open the file in any Python IDE or run it from the terminal.
  

3. Follow the instructions in the console to guess the number!

## 💡 What I learned
This project helped me understand how to write and structure basic Python programs, use loops and conditions, and handle user input.
