# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m YASHWANTH

Iâ€™m a beginner Python developer, exploring how to build small projects to learn real-world coding.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Python basics, data structures, and automation
- How to build simple CLI tools and calculators
- How to use Git and GitHub to share my work

ðŸ”­ My goals:
- Become confident in writing clean, working code
- Start building bigger projects, like web apps or APIs
- Contribute to open source in the future

âœ¨ Fun fact:
When I get stuck, I use ChatGPT to explain concepts and debug problems â€” but I want to understand enough to solve them myself!
